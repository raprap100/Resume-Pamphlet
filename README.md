# Raphael Ureta – Interactive Resume (Work in Progress)
- View my project: https://raprap100.github.io/Resume-Pamphlet/

An interactive flip-book style portfolio and résumé built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

This site showcases my background in **Web Development** and **Quality Assurance** — including skills such as Trello, JIRA, and test case design — and features my capstone project **E-Likha**.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress:**  
> Some flip/animation logic is still being refined (page navigation buttons). Expect occasional layout or animation quirks.
